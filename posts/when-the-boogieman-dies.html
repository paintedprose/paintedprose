      <section class="content">
        <p>Rejoice.<br> Rejoice that fear no longer clings,<br> that I need not shrink beneath its wings.</p>
        <p>Embrace the sunlight again,<br> remember what it was before,<br> the pain, the fear, the grotesque sway<br> that shadowed every passing day.</p>
        <p>At one point it was a child,<br> a lover, quiet, meek, and mild,<br> a friend, a spouse, a parent too,<br> the boogieman now made human through.</p>
        <p>No longer permanent, yet weight remains.<br> Who carries the memory of its chains?<br>Only the things it left behind<br> can bear the echoes trapped in mind.</p>
        <p>I thought the earth could hold its end,<br> but I became the hope it failed to send.<br>A small flame flickered, almost gone,<br> I carry both its grief and song.</p>
        <p>I am its daughter,<br> its victim,<br> its remnants,<br> drawn back always to that ghost.</p>
        <p>A spirit it forgot to honor,<br> a joy it once wanted to flower.</p>
        <p>But what do I do with the pain?<br> It has not left; the scars still ache during the rain.</p>
        <p>Even now, the quiet hums with sorrow.<br> Who can I fault for what was borrowed?<br>It was shaped by hands before my time,<br> by echoes carried down the line.</p>
        <p>Origins no longer matter.<br> Yet still they whisper, faint and scattered.<br>And from that grief, I bear the flame—<br> a quiet witness to its name.</p>
