INSTALL GUIDE — Subtle Animations + Journal Post Generator

1) Upload to your repo:
   - assets/motion/animations.css
   - assets/motion/animations.js
   - tools/post-maker.html

2) Wire the animations on every page:
   In the <head> of each page (index.html, journal.html, etc.), add:
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/motion/animations.css" />
   <script defer src="assets/motion/animations.js"></script>

3) Use the Post Generator:
   Visit /tools/post-maker.html on your live site (or open the file locally).
   - Fill Title, Date, Tags
   - Paste your poem (blank lines produce new paragraphs)
   - Click “Download post file” (it will be named from your title, e.g. drought.html)
   - Upload the file into posts/ in your repo
   - Click “Copy journal snippet” and paste inside <section class="entries"> in journal.html

4) Notes:
   - Animations respect “prefers-reduced-motion” automatically.
   - Hero parallax is very subtle; remove by deleting animations.js or the parallax block.
   - You can adjust hover float by editing the .card:hover rule in animations.css.
